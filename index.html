                        Headgear can be an article of fashion, usually hats, caps or hoods. The formal man's black silk
                        top
                        hat was formerly an indispensable portion of the suit, and women's hats have, over the years,
                        attained a fantastic number of shapes ranging from immense confections to no more than a few
                        bits of
                        cloth and decorations piled on top of the head. Some hats, such as Deep Blue Sea, are showpiece
                        creations created more as works of art than as practical items of fashion, and may be worth
                        thousands or millions of dollars.

                    <p>
                        A top is an item of clothing that covers at least the chest, but which usually covers most of
                        the
                        upper human body between the neck and the waistline. The bottom of tops can be as short as
                        mid-torso, or as long as mid-thigh. Men's tops are generally paired with pants, and women's with
                        pants or skirts. Common types of tops are t-shirts, blouses and shirts.

                <h3> Shoes </h3>
                <div>
                    <p> A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. They are often
                        worn
                        with a sock. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has
                        varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with form originally being tied to
                        function. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is still
                        vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes
                        protect against. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are
                        required
                        footwear at industrial worksites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very
                        high
                        heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear varies widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic
                        sandals
                        may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes
                        made
                        by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for
                        large
                        sums of money. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed
                        specifically
                        for mountaineering or skiing, while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which
                        have
                        transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Traditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, but are increasingly being
                        made
                        from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials. Globally, the shoe industry is
                        a $200 billion a year industry. 90% of shoes end up in land-fills, because the materials are
                        hard
                        to separate, recycle or otherwise reuse.
